# Employee Management System

## Overview
This is a simple Employee Management System built using Node.js. The system allows users to:
- Add new employees
- List all employees
- Retrieve employee details by ID
- Filter employees based on various criteria
- Edit employee details
- Delete employees

The data is stored in a JSON file (`employee.json`), and all operations are performed through command-line arguments.
